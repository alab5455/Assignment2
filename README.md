#The second Heuristic Function is calculating the Euclidean distance.
The Euclidean Distance can be calculated using the pythagorean theorem (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2)
I used this because I think that we should consider the shortest path instead of the border path from one node to another
For Maze 1, there is no difference between both Heuristic Functions
For Maze 2, the Manhattan distance visited less number of nodes than the Euclidean distance

#For the command line, first you choose the maze that you want to see the solution for, and then you choose the Heuristic Function that you want to use in your calculation

#I used Graph implementation instead of Nodes implementation
